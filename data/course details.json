        "As a business guy I have no place in programming." Ten years ago you could have gotten away with that statement. Today you say that to your colleagues and they scoff at you before they go back to their computers to fix real problems and do real work.
        
        If you want to do something useful start by learning Javascript . In these days when the browser is central to all computer use knowing "the language of the browser" is the most important step. A few years ago Javascript potential was uncertain and many programmers considered it useless. These days however competent programmers have identified Javascript real potential and uses and it has gone from a toy language to the main language of the browser. It has become one of the most useful languages of this era. Every developer needs at least a basic understanding of Javascript. A developer who knows Javascript is the rockstar of the company and is in constant demand by employers. Our online Javascript
        
        course will get you started by teaching all the essential aspects of coding in Javascript. So... what's it gonna be?

        How to start building AI with no previous coding experience using Python
        How to merge AI with OpenAI Gym to learn as effectively as possible
        How to optimize your AI to reach its maximum potential in the real world
        Here is what you will get with this course:
        
        
        1. Complete beginner to expert AI skills – Learn to code self-improving AI for a range of purposes. In fact, we code together with you. Every tutorial starts with a blank page and we write up the code from scratch. This way you can follow along and understand exactly how the code comes together and what each line means.
        
        2. Code templates – Plus, you’ll get downloadable Python code templates for every AI you build in the course. This makes building truly unique AI as simple as changing a few lines of code. If you unleash your imagination, the potential is unlimited.
        
        3. Intuition Tutorials – Where most courses simply bombard you with dense theory and set you on your way, we believe in developing a deep understanding for not only what you’re doing, but why you’re doing it. That’s why we don’t throw complex mathematics at you, but focus on building up your intuition in coding AI making for infinitely better results down the line.
